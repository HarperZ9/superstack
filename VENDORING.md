# Vendoring a superstack file

An engine uses the contract by copying one file into its own tree and pinning that file's SHA-256. There is no package to install and nothing to fetch at run time. The engine's CI then checks two things: the copy still has the pinned hash, and it still passes the shared vectors.

## 1. Choose the file

| Language | File | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| Python | `superstack.py` | Python 3.11 or later, standard library only |
| JavaScript | `superstack.mjs` | Any browser with ES modules, or Node 20 or later |
| C++ | `superstack.hpp` | A C++23 compiler, standard library only |

## 2. Copy it from a release

1. Take the file from a tagged release, for example `v0.1.0`, never from a branch.
2. Take `SHA256SUMS` from the same tag. It lists the hash of each implementation.
3. Copy the file byte for byte. You may rename it (the site keeps it as `system/media-engine/contracts.mjs`). Do not edit it: any change, even whitespace, changes the hash.
4. Keep LF line endings. Add this line to your `.gitattributes`, with your own path:

   ```
   system/media-engine/contracts.mjs text eol=lf
   ```

   Without it, a Windows checkout with `core.autocrlf` rewrites the line endings and the hash check fails.

5. Record the pin next to the copy, for example in a `SUPERSTACK.sha256` file or a comment in your build config:

   ```
   <sha256 from SHA256SUMS>  system/media-engine/contracts.mjs  superstack.mjs v0.1.0
   ```

The file carries its whole MIT notice, so the copy needs nothing else to meet the licence. `docs/LICENSING.md` covers vendoring into reserved, AGPL, FSL and Fair Source projects.

## 3. Check the copy in CI

`tools/check_vendored.py` uses only the Python standard library. Copy it alongside, or run it from a checkout of this repository:

```
python tools/check_vendored.py system/media-engine/contracts.mjs --expect <pinned sha256>
python tools/check_vendored.py vendor/superstack.py --sums SHA256SUMS
python tools/check_vendored.py system/media-engine/contracts.mjs --sums SHA256SUMS --as superstack.mjs
```

It prints MATCH and exits 0 when the bytes match, and prints DRIFT and exits 1 otherwise. When the only difference is CRLF line endings, it says so.

Without Python, any SHA-256 tool works:

```
sha256sum vendor/superstack.hpp                                  # Linux
Get-FileHash vendor\superstack.hpp -Algorithm SHA256             # PowerShell
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').createHash('sha256').update(require('fs').readFileSync(process.argv[1])).digest('hex'))" vendor/superstack.mjs
```

## 4. Run the vectors in your CI

A hash match shows the file is unchanged. The vectors show it still behaves as the contract says on your runtime: your Python, your Node, your compiler.

1. Copy `vectors/` from the same tag.
2. Run the runner for your language from the same tag:
   - `python tests/run_vectors.py --impl <your copy>`
   - `node tests/run_vectors.mjs --impl <your copy>`
   - C++: build `tests/run_vectors.cpp` with `-I` pointing at the folder that holds `superstack.hpp`, then run it with the folder that holds `vectors/`.
3. Fail the build on a non-zero exit.

Each runner checks `vectors/MANIFEST.json` first, so a vector file that was edited by hand fails too.

## 5. Upgrade

1. Read the release notes and the changes to `SPEC.md`.
2. Copy the new file, the new `SHA256SUMS` and the new `vectors/`.
3. Update the pin in the same commit.
4. Run your own suite. A rule change that alters bytes comes with a new rule id (SPEC.md section 12), so artefacts already made under the old id keep verifying.

## 6. Do not

- Do not import the file from a URL at run time. The pin is the point.
- Do not patch the copy. Open an issue or a pull request here, so all three languages change together under new vectors.
- Do not mix files from different releases in one project.
